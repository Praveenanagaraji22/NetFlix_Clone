## Date: 10/7/25
## Objective:
To create a modern, responsive navigation bar using CSS Flexbox, mimicking real-world websites like Netflix. This helps reinforce alignment, spacing, and layout structuring using Flexbox properties.

## Tasks:

#### 1. Structure the HTML Layout:
Use a ```<nav>``` tag as the main container.

Add a brand logo/title on the left using a ```<div> or <h1>```.

Add navigation links like Home, Menu, About, Contact, and Login using a ```<ul> with <li> and <a>```.

#### 2. Apply Flexbox for Layout:
Use display: flex on the ```<nav>``` container.

Use justify-content: space-between to align the logo and menu.

Use align-items: center to vertically center both sections.

Style list items with horizontal spacing using gap or margin.

#### 3. Style Like a Real-World Navbar:
Add background color (e.g., dark or gradient like Netflix/Zomato).

Style text with bold fonts, hover effects, and link styling.

Remove default ul and li styles (list-style: none, text-decoration: none).

#### 4. Bonus Enhancements:
Add a hover underline or button effect on links.

Make it responsive using flex-wrap or media queries.

Fix the nav bar to top with position: sticky.
